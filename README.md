Seamless integration of Amazon EC2 and S3 for scalable cloud solutions for bacup and restore data - *S3* serves as a centralized backup repository for critical application data, with automated scripts running on EC2 instances to regularly back up data to S3, ensuring data durability and recovery in case of failure. Users access the application through a browser over the internet. The request is directed to the App Server, which is hosted in the public subnet via an Internet Gateway. The App Server processes the request and, if necessary, communicates with the DB Server located in the private subnet through a NAT Gateway. The DB Server responds with the required data, which is sent back through the App Server to the users, ensuring a secure and efficient workflow.
